Week 4 Homework

This homework assingment was my first attempt at using jQuery. I actually really enjoyed its ease of use compared to my previous struggles with vanilla JS. The most difficult part of this assignment for me was getting the new crystal values to update at the end of a game. Ultimately this was resolved by calling the functions in proper order- something I had not really dealt with too much at the point of this assignment.
